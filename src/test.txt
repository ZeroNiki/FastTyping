The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
A watched pot never boils.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Better late than never.
The early bird catches the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To err is human; to forgive, divine.
Actions speak louder than words.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
Success is not the key to happiness; happiness is the key to success.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
It's not whether you get knocked down; it's whether you get up.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.
